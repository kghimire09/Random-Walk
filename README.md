# Random-Walk
Create a Swing GUI program that consists of a JFrame that holds one JPanel (which I will call the drawing panel). Divide the drawing panel into a grid (the size of which should be controlled by command line arguments and defaulting to 50 by 50) of cells. Each cell should start off black. Draw thin grey lines between each cell of the grid. The current cell should be red and the current cell should start around the middle of the panel. Your program should then simulate a random walk around the screen i.e. each time step (the length of which is up to you, but should be such that the simulation is easy to follow) the current cell should move one step either up, down, left, or right and should not be allowed to walk off of the screen. Note that the size of the cells will stay fixed, so rows and columns will have to be "added" or "removed" as the frame is resized.
